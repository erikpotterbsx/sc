SC - The Spreadsheet Calculator
===============================

SC is a curses-based spreadsheet, written in the ancient times by James
Gosling.  This tree is forked off the 7.16 release, with the goal of
updating the code to modern standards, pruning obsolete cruft (like VMS
support, who still has those?), and just cleaning the heck out of it.

To build, clone the repository, configure && make install. Run sc.
